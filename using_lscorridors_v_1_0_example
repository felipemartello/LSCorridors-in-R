#REQUIRED PACKAGES
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgrass7)
library(rgdal)

#SETTING WORKING DIRECTORY
setwd("C:\\LScorridors_R_v1.0") #setting working director

#INPUT FILES 
resist  <-raster("rst_map_exmpl.tif") #resistance raster 
st  <-raster("hbt_clump.tif") #raster with habitat patches identifyed by code (ID)

#PARAMETERS
dir.grass  <-"C:\\Program Files\\GRASS GIS 7.4.0" # GRASS directory
output_fld  <-"C:\\LScorridors_R_v1.0\\output" # output folder (create automatically)
var  <-10 # levels of variation between corridors of the same method (we suggest that this value does not exceed 10% of the highest resistance)
scl  <-300 # landscape scale
st_id  <-c(2,69,14,54) #ID of the pairs of patches that shoud be connected (same code of the st raster)  

#NUMBER OF SIMULATION BY METHOD
MP  <-2 #number of simulations for method without landscape perspective
MLavg  <-2 #number of simulations for method regarding landscape resistance average (generalist organism)
MLmin  <-2 #number of simulations for method regarding landscape resistance minimum (oportunist organism)
MLmax  <-2 #number of simulations for method regarding landscape resistance maximun (restritive organism)

#USING THE FUNCTION (function must be loaded before)
lscorricors(resist,st,st_id,var,scl,MP,MLavg,MLmin,MLmax)

#OUTPUT: function create: a) a shape file for each corridor simulated; b)RSFI raster for each method - a raster wherein pixels values 
#indicates the number of simulated corridors that crossed the pixel; c) the file " .txt", describing corridors information
